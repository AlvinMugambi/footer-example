          Launch icon! A simple task, that can become a painful problem/challenge if we don’t know exactly what to do. What we need to implement here, is a two step process for each one of the native platforms:
Prepare launch icons with proper dimensions for all the possible screen sizes (i.e. iPhone SE, iPhone 7, iPhone X etc)
Place them inside the native app folder and replace the existing default ones.
And of course repeat both steps for the remaining native platform (i.e. Android)
But well, if it is your first React Native app and you come from a web developer background as I did, you are not familiar with the details mentioned above; at least not just yet.
So, I started looking for a way to implement this for both platforms (iOS, Android) fast and easy instead of having to figure out all the details. Luckily, I found the way :D
RN toolbox to the rescue
There is a toolset for React Native, called RN toolbox. It is a set of Yeoman generators that can help with project kickstart.
We are going to install and use it to resize and place all the needed icons for us! Image resizing is achieved with the help of ImageMagick tool, so we need to install this as well. Let’s get started!
Install the tools
To use RN toolbox, we need a minimum of node 6 already installed.
Then, we install it with npm globally as shown below:
npm install -g yo generator-rn-toolbox
For ImageMagick now, installation steps are different per platform and they can all be found in the download section of the website.
Use the tools!
Prepare a single icon file of 200x200px. If you don’t have one ready just use the sample below
